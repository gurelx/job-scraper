# Job Scrapper

A web scraper for senecaworks portal that I can grab new jobs to a JSON file

## Description

I have used Node.js and [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev) to open up the [Seneca Works](https://sw.senecacollege.ca/home.htm) portal and log-in using my credentials. Then the application simply grabs the jobs related to my program (and which I did not applied already) and saves them in a JSON file.
